2. Audience profile: Include key details about the target audience, such as:
   - Demographic information
   - Relationship status
   - Family structure
   - Occupation
   - Interests and hobbies
   - Values and priorities

3. Question guidelines: Specify the characteristics of the questions to be generated, including:
   - Tone (e.g., introspective, lighthearted, challenging)
   - Purpose (e.g., spark conversation, encourage reflection, strengthen bonds)
   - Structure (e.g., open-ended, specific but not restrictive)

4. Diversity instructions: Include directions for ensuring variety in the types of questions generated.

5. Relevance criteria: Explain how the questions should relate to the audience's lifestyle and interests.

6. Constraints: Mention any topics or types of questions to avoid.

7. Uniqueness requirement: Include instructions for avoiding repetition, possibly by referencing previously asked questions.

8. Output format: Specify how the AI should present its generated question.

Ensure the prompt is clear, concise, and provides enough detail for the AI to generate high-quality, tailored questions consistently. The resulting prompt should be adaptable to different audiences by modifying the audience profile and specific guidelines.
